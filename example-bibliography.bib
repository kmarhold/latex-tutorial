	abstract = {The Honda {EV} Plus was the first battery electric vehicle from a major automaker with non-lead acid batteries. Roughly 340 {EV} Plus models were produced and released. The {EV} Plus was taken out of production in 1999 when Honda announced the release of its first hybrid electric vehicle, the Honda Insight. The {EV} Plus was made to learn about advanced battery use in an electric car and to meet California Air Resources Board requirements for zero-emission vehicles, the same as the new General Motors {EV}1. It served as a test bed for the pancake-style motor, electronic control unit, power control unit and the Nickel–metal hydride battery ({NiMH}) later used in Honda hybrids and developed further in the first Honda {FCX} Fuel Cell Vehicles made from returned (decommissioned) {EV} Plus chassis.
The {EV} Plus featured on-board conductive charging with the Avcon connector, passive battery balancing, regenerative braking and deceleration, {AC}/heat-pump climate control, {HID} headlights, 4 seats, and electrically heated windshield. Units deployed in cold climates also had oil-fired heaters for faster cabin heating and passenger comfort. As with virtually all vehicles, range was affected by driving style: rapid acceleration, high speeds, and fast stops lowered the all-electric range significantly. United States Environmental Protection Agency rated at 81 miles (130 km), careful driving would give it a range of just over 100 miles (160 km). The {EV} Plus came with a 12 V battery for running normal 12 volt accessories and lighting.},
